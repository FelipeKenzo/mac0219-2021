Power takes Potency
    Result is 1
    While Potency is greater than 0
        Put Result * 2 into Result
        Knock Potency down
    (blank line ending While block)
    Give Back Result
(blank line ending function declaration)

Modulus takes Number and Divisor
    Let x be Number / Divisor
    Let y be x 
    Turn down x
    Let modulo be y - x
    Give back modulo * Divisor
(blank line ending function declaration)

Listen to Input
Put Power taking Input into N
Primes is 1
Special Primes is 1
Let Sieve at N be mysterious
i is 2
While i is lower than N+1
    Let Sieve at i be true
    Build i up
(blank line ending While block)
i is 3
While i is lower than N+1
    Let conditional be Sieve at i
    If conditional is ok
        Build Primes up
        If Modulus taking i, 4 is not 3
            Build Special Primes up
        (blank line ending If block)
        Put i*i into j
        While j is lower than N+1
            Put false into Sieve at j
            Let j be with 2*i
        (blank line ending While block)
    (blank line ending If block)
    Build i up, up
(blank line ending While block)
