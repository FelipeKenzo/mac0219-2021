Power takes Potency
    Result is 1
    While Potency is greater than 0
        Put Result * 2 into Result
        Knock Potency down
    (blank line ending While block)
    Give Back Result
(blank line ending function declaration)

Modulus takes Number and Divisor
    While Number is as high as Divisor
        Put Number minus Divisor into Number
    (blank line ending While block)
    Give back Number
(blank line ending function declaration)

Listen to Input
Put Power taking Input into N
Primes is 0
Special Primes is 0
Let Sieve at N be mysterious
i is 2
While i is lower than N+1
    Let Sieve at i be true
    Build i up
(blank line ending While block)
i is 2
While i is lower than N+1
    Let conditional be Sieve at i
    If conditional is ok
        Build Primes up
        If Modulus taking i, 4 is not 3
            Build Special Primes up
        (blank line ending If block)
        Put i*2 into j
        While j is lower than N+1
            Let Sieve at j be false
            Let j be j + i
        (blank line ending While block)
    (blank line ending If block)
    Build i up
